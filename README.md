# Excel Project---Complete-Hospital-Emergency-Room-Data
We will build a full Emergency Room Data Project in Excel with an interactive dashboard to analyse key hospital insights. We will use Power query to Extract and Transform data, Power Pivot to Create relationship and Add DAX Formula then Pivot Tables to generate reports, AND Data Visualization techniques to create an interactive dashboard that helps hospitals optimize emergency room operations.

# Key Insights Covered in the Dashboard:

✅ Total Number of Patients
✅ Average Wait Time to See a Patient
✅ Patient Admission Status (Admitted/Not Admitted)
✅ Patient Age Distribution
✅ Gender Analysis
✅ Department Referrals
✅ Percentage of Patients Seen Within 30 Minutes
